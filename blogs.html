                      <strong>Var:</strong> 
                      Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.<br>
                      <strong>Scope of var:</strong>
                      Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.<br>
                      
                      The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.<br>
                      
                      var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.<br>
                      
                      <strong>var variables can be re-declared and updated:</strong>
                      This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Hoisting of var:</strong>
                      Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Let:</strong>
                      let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.<br>
                      
                      <strong>let is block scoped:</strong>
                      A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.<br>
                      
                      <strong>let can be updated but not re-declared:</strong>
                      Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Hoisting of let:</strong>
                      Just like  var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Const:</strong>
                      Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.<br>
                      
                      <strong>const declarations are block scoped:</strong>
                      Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.<br>
                      
                      <strong>const cannot be updated or re-declared:</strong>
                      This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Hoisting of const:</strong>
                      Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Summary:</strong>
                      var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
                      var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
                      They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
                      While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

                      <strong>Arguments binding:</strong> 
                      Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Use of this keyword:</strong>
                      Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.<br>
                      
                      <strong>Using new keyword:</strong>
                      Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.<br>
                      
                      However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.<br>
                      
                      <strong>No duplicate named parameters:</strong>
                      Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.

                      <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
